    "The following is an exploring question with bonus points. It is great if you try to do this question, but it is **totally optional**. In this question, we will investigate a recent SOTA technique to improve the generalization ability of deep nets named *Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)* ([link to the main paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6Tm1mposlrM)).  Furthermore, SAM is simple and efficient technique, but roughly doubles the training time due to its required computation. If you have an idea to improve SAM, it would be a great paper to top-tier venues in machine learning and computer vision. Highly recommend to give it a try. "
